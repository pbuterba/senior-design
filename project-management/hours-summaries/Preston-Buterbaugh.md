# Preston Buterbaugh Hours Summary/Justification
In the fall, most of my hours were spent working with the team on the class assignments, and in team meetings with our advisor, as we planned out the details of the project architecture.
The latter half of the semester saw the start of research and proof-of-concept implementation. My hours during this portion of the semseter involved cleaning up the existing repository for the project,
researching different server implementations, and implementing some basic API calls.
In the spring, we kicked off more focused implementation, and I spent many hours implementing the API call to compile C code. This involved a lot of experimentation with different Linux
commands to get the necessary data needed from the compilation, and send it back in a structured response. Finally, the later portion of the spring semester involved a lot of research into
the details of the Iced API, and trial and error experimentation to use this API to determine the intended effects of assembly instructions. Implementing these instructions in a consistent
way that would work for a sufficient variety of circumstances took many hours of work and testing.
