# Project Abstract
Our project enhances "Hackademia," a tool for teaching networking and programming. Key updates include a login system for saving user progress, a module to compile C code into Intel x86 assembly with stack visualization and step-through functionality, and a redesigned UI for improved usability. Additional features in assembly and networking may be added, time permitting.
