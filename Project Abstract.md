# Project Abstract
Our project enhanced the Hackademia teaching tool for networks and assembly programming. Our module, Dynamic Call Stack, lets users input C code and dynamically compiles it to assembly using the iced-x86 library. Additionally, it allows switching between AT&T and Intel syntax and 32 and 64 bits. Finally, we initialized step-through functionality for instruction effects on registers and the stack.
