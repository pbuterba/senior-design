### Project Sought
I am open to any project idea, but it is important to me that I am optimizing the wide variety of skill sets, in both front-end and back-end, that I have acquired throughout my academic and co-op experiences. I would enjoy working on a project that gives back towards a community in some way, whether that is academic, professional, environmental, communal, etc.
