## Capstone Sought 
I am looking for capstone that has a UI component to it and that is focused on enhancing user performance and productivity. I really enjoy front end programming and would like to work with that as well as using API calls. I think something that uses data modeling or data managemnt would also be great as I have previous experience in that and enjoy working on those aspects.
