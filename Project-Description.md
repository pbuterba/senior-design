## Project Topic Area
Our senior design project focuses on remodeling and enhancing the "Hackademia" server, a classroom learning tool designed to teach and explain various networking and programming concepts. Our work includes three primary components. First, we are implementing a login system to enable users to save progress and access personalized data. Second, we are developing a dynamic C-to-assembly module, which compiles user-provided C code into Intel x86 assembly, visualizes the stack, and allows users to step through the code execution process interactively. Additional modules, focusing on assembly and networking concepts, may also be introduced to expand the platform’s educational scope, time permitting. Finally, we aim to perform a comprehensive redesign of the application’s user interface to improve usability and modernize its aesthetics. These enhancements are intended to make Hackademia a more engaging and versatile tool for teaching key computer science topics in an interactive and practical manner.
