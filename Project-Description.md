## Project Topic Area
Our senior design project focused on remodeling and enhancing the "Hackademia" server, a classroom learning tool designed to teach and explain various networking and programming concepts. Our work included three primary components. First, we created a process for the module to take input C code and compile it to 32-bit and 64-bit hex code using Linux command line tools. Second, we developed a procedure for the application to extract the byte code and provide corresponding assembly code using the iced-x86 decoder library, in both AT&T and Intel syntax. Finally, we initialized step-through functionality for specific instructions and their effects on registers and the stack. Throughout the entire development process, we also performed a comprehensive redesign of the applicationâ€™s user interface to improve usability and modernize its aesthetics. These enhancements are intended to make Hackademia a more engaging and versatile tool for teaching key computer science topics in an interactive and practical manner.
