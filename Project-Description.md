## Project Topic Area
The goal of our project is to develop a module to dynamically compile input C code and output the corresponding assembly version code. Additionally, this module will depict the stack of the assembly output, and allow the user to step through the code. Other modules in the areas of assembly and networking may be added as well, time permitting.
